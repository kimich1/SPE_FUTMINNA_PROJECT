# CO₂ Emission Prediction — SPE FUTMINNA Chapter (2024)

## 📌 Overview
This project was completed under the **Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) FUTMINNA Chapter** competition in 2024.  
The goal was to solve an energy-related problem by predicting **CO₂ emissions** using machine learning and deploying the solution through a **Streamlit web app**.

## 🌍 Motivation
Accurate CO₂ emission prediction is crucial for reducing environmental impact in the energy sector.  
This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can be applied to monitor and forecast emissions effectively.

## ⚡ Features
- Data preprocessing and model training for CO₂ prediction  
- Model evaluation with metrics such as **MAE, RMSE, and R²**  
- Interactive **Streamlit app** for visualization and predictions  

## 🚀 Deployment
The application was deployed using **Streamlit** for easy access and demonstration.
