CO₂ Emission Prediction — SPE FUTMINNA Chapter (2024)
Overview

This project was completed under the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) FUTMINNA Chapter competition in 2024. The goal was to solve an energy-related problem by predicting CO₂ emissions using machine learning and deploying the solution through a Streamlit app.

Motivation

Accurate CO₂ emission prediction is vital for reducing environmental impact in the energy sector. This project shows how machine learning can be applied to monitor and forecast emissions effectively.

Features

Data preprocessing and model training for CO₂ prediction

Model evaluation with metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R²

Interactive Streamlit app and predictions

Deployment

The app was deployed using Streamlit for easy access and demonstration.
